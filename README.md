This projects builds classification models using various algorithms for a loan prediction task. Initially, it preprocesses categorical variables by encoding them using LabelEncoder. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, and standardizes the features using StandardScaler. Three classification algorithms - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest - are trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data using accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
